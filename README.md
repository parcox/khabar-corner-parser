Grab Khabar corner text from Republika online

This tiny python script let you grab khabar corner text on http://www.republika.co.id. I made this basically for <a href='https://github.com/SamRothCA/Today-Scripts'>Today Scripts</a>, a notification widget application for OS X 10.+ , but it could be used from another application like Conky(Linux), GeekTool, or just from Terminal.

# About Khabar corner.
It is simply part of Republika website that displays verses of al-Quran and Hadith randomly. 

# What do you need?
This script requires <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4">beautifulsoup4</a> python module. You can use pip or easy_install to install it.
