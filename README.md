Grab Khabar corner text from Republika online

This tiny python script let you grab khabar corner text on http://www.republika.co.id. I made this basically for <a href='https://github.com/SamRothCA/Today-Scripts'>Today Scripts</a>, a notification widget application for OS X 10.+ , but it could be used from another application like Conky(Linux), GeekTool, or directly from Terminal.
